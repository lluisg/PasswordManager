    text = "This is a compressed and simplified version of the Readme.txt file. You should find \n \
        the original next to the program in the zip file downloaded. \n \
        The first user and password the program is going to ask you are the ones that you will \n \
        be using to protect the other passwords, as so it will be the only password not stored, \n \
        be cautious and don't forget it! \n \
        #------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \
        - name: it references at how you will identify the password. It's the part that will be \n \
        asked to identify it when searching and/or editing \n \
        - user: username, as it usually goes along with the password. \n \
        - password: the password itself.  \n \
        - tag: can be used to group different passwords with a tag. Only one allowed per password\n \
        #------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \
        Wherever the executable file for the program is, two more files will appear: user.info and\n \
        passwords.info. The important part to allow this program running perfectly is to have these\n \
        two files always at the same folder as the executable. \n \
        You can recover the passwords if the user file is lost, but not vice-versa. \n \
        If you change your laptop or something, you only need to carry your passwords file and use \n \
        the same password. \n \
